        <dd>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</dd></dl>

            <li><dt id="2">Core Java</dt>
            <dd>Core Java refers to the foundational concepts and basic features of the Java programming language. It includes essential programming constructs such as variables, data types, operators, control statements, and arrays. Core Java forms the basis for learning Java and is used for developing general-purpose applications. It encompasses fundamental concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), exception handling, and multiple inheritance, and it is part of the Java Standard Edition (SE).</dd></li>
            <li><dt id="3">Advance JAva</dt>
            <dd>Advanced Java, also known as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), is a sub-category of the Java programming language that focuses on developing web-based applications, enterprise applications, and cloud-based software. It builds upon the foundational concepts of Core Java and introduces more advanced topics such as database connectivity, networking, servlets, web services, and frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. Advanced Java is designed to support the needs of enterprise and cloud-based applications, offering more flexibility in terms of performance, scalability, and security</dd></li>
            <li><dt id="4">J2EE</dt>
            <dd>Advanced J2EE, or Advanced Java Enterprise Edition, refers to the more sophisticated and advanced concepts and technologies within the Java programming language that are used for developing enterprise-level and web-based applications. It builds upon the foundational skills and concepts of Core Java and introduces more advanced features necessary for creating complex, high-performance applications.</dd></li>

        <dd>Advanced Python refers to more complex and sophisticated concepts and techniques that build upon the basics of the language. These topics are generally considered too difficult for beginners and include areas like functional programming, generators, decorators, and more. Advanced Python is aimed at programmers who have a solid foundation in Python and are looking to deepen their understanding and skills.</dd>

            <li><dt id="6">Core Python</dt>
            <dd>Core Python refers to the fundamental and essential aspects of the Python programming language. It includes basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, modules, and other core components that form the foundation of Python programming. This core knowledge provides the necessary building blocks and functionalities to develop a wide range of applications. Additionally, Core Python has a vast and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the language, provide support, and create a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.</dd></li>
            <li><dt id="7">Advance Python</dt>
            <dd>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, and is often described as a “batteries included” language due to its comprehensive standard library. It is widely used in various applications such as web development, data science, and machine learning, and is popular for its efficiency and ability to run on multiple platforms.
